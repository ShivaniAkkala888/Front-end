Any HR will first look at your cover letter/email body before opening your resume. So if you specify good contents in cover letter It will definitely gives some hints to HR before opening your resume also it saves the HR time.

At many times your resume gets shortlisted when HR is just impressed with the cover letter because they may not find time to look in to your resume since your cover letter provided most of the information.
